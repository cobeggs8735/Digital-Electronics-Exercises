Collection of exercise files for Digital Electronics class (ESET 219) in the Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution department at Texas A&amp;M University

## Summary
The .ms14 file extension is typically associated with Multisim, which is circuit simulation software provided by National Instruments. Files with this extension usually contain electronic circuit schematics, components, wiring, and simulation settings.

This means the files in all of the Lab folders contains the schematic and simulation setup for Digital Electronics exercise projectsâ€”representing the design and the testing of various digital circuits. To see the details (such as which components are used and how the circuit works), you will need to open this files in NI Multisim.
